<h2>Subscription costs to scientific publishers in Finland 2010-2017</h2>
<p>This post provides a brief overview of the subscription prices paid by Finnish research institutions to academic publishers in 2010-2017.</p>
<p>Finland is possibly the only country that has systematically released subscription prices that research libraries pay to academic publishers <a href="https://avointiede.fi/fi/avoimet-julkaisut/kustantajahintatietoja">as open data</a>. The data is available for all major research institutions in Finland. Recently, an updated data set for 2010–2017 was made openly available at <a href="https://avointiede.fi/fi/avoimet-julkaisut/kustantajahintatietoja">avointiede.fi</a>. In addition, <a href="https://www.kansalliskirjasto.fi/extra/finelib_julkinen/">full text agreements</a> with many publishers have been <a href="http://finelib.fi/negotiations/agreements/">made available</a>. The subscription price data was initially provided by Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture, and its Open Science and Research Initiative funded 2014–2017, after a successful Freedom of Information request by the Finnish Open Science community, as summarized <a href="https://www.mostlyphysics.net/blog/2016/6/13/finland-takes-leading-role-in-the-openness-of-academic-journal-pricing">elsewhere</a>.

<h2>Overall subscription costs 2010-2017</h2>
<p>Based on the data collected by the Ministry of Education, Finland paid in total
198.7 million EUR subscription and other
fees on scientific publishing in 2010-2017. The average annual costs for in Finland were 25 MEUR.</p>
<p>Data for the top-10 publishers in the UK 2010-2014 is available in <a href="https://olh.openlibhums.org/articles/10.16995/olh.72/#B45">Lawson, Meghreblian &amp; Brook, 2017</a> (<a href="https://olh.openlibhums.org/articles/10.16995/olh.72">Table 1</a>). During this period the UK paid altogether 4319 MEUR (rough estimate based on the exchange rate June 12, 2016) for the top-10 publishers. Finland paid 62 MEUR for the same top-10 publishers in 2010-2014. This is 17.1% of the UK expenditure <em>per capita</em>. It could be that the data is not directly comparable but this will require further investigation.</p>
<p>Information for Finland is available by agreement type, organization
type, and subscription category.</p>

<h3>Costs by publisher</h3>
<p>Overall, the Finnish data covers 376 unique publishers. The figure indicates the total subscription fees paid to the top publishers 2010-2017. One third of the total costs go to Elsevier, which has been often <a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2014/04/24/elsevier-journals-some-facts/">criticized</a> for its huge <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0127502">profit margins</a>. The costs are given per bundle, so we cannot compare average journal prices among individual publishers based on this data.</p>

<p>The total costs paid to scientific publishers by Finland have increased roughly 10% per year in 2010-2017 (annual increase is indicated in the left figure). The top-10 publishers correspond to 75% of the overall costs (right figure).</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2018-12-05-FOI_files/figure-html/foi-costbytime-1.png" width="860px" /></p>
<p>Let us compare the relative increase in publisher costs. The costs are normalized to 1 in 2010, and the top 10 publishers with the highest cost increase in 2010-2017 are shown. The 275 publishers that did not have declared costs in 2010 or 2017 are excluded.</p>

<h3>Costs by organization</h3>
<p>The Finnish data collection includes 82 organizations. The universities (‘yliopisto’) are responsible of 78.9% of all costs (left figure); University of Helsinki had the highest total costs in 2010-2017 (37.9 MEUR; top institutions shown in the right figure).</p>

<p>Finally, let us compare the relative share of costs per
institution. The top organizations with the highest total costs are
shown.</p>
